The Sidesheet is a controlled component. This means that you should control its
opening and closing from "outside".

Since it doesn't accept a `title` prop similar to the modal, you should opt for providing the
`aria-describedby` and `aria-labeledby` props with the proper text in all of the SideSheet
components within your app.

```typescript jsx
const Example = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open Sidesheet</Button>
      <SideSheet open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <Flex alignItems="center" mb={8}>
          <IconButton
            icon="arrow-back"
            aria-label="Dismiss Dialog"
            variant="ghost"
            variantColor="navyblue-300"
          />
          <Heading size="medium" ml={2}>
            Output settings
          </Heading>
        </Flex>
        Add a new output below to deliver alerts to a specific application for further triage.
      </SideSheet>
    </div>
  );
};

<Example />;
```
