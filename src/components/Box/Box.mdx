Responsive box-model layout component.

The Box component is the primary component that powers the entire library. It accepts as props
almost all CSS properties and automatically converts theme values to actual browser-friendly values.

For example you can say `fontSize="medium"` and it will know to translate it to proper rem/px values.

A Box with the 9th value on the spacing scale, with large font and blue background:

```typescript jsx
<Box p={9} width={300} bg="blue-400" fontSize="large">
  Box
</Box>
```

A Box with the red font color and huge font-size:

```typescript jsx
<Box color="red-300" fontSize="2x-large">
  Box
</Box>
```

A Box that has a responsive width according to the screen size:

```typescript jsx
<Box p={9} bg="red-200" width={[300, 600, 900]} fontSize="2x-large">
  Box
</Box>
```

A Box can also implement other components under the hood and accept its props:

```typescript jsx
<Box as={Button} variantColor="pink-700">
  Box
</Box>
```
