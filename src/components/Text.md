```jsx harmony
<Text color="grey500" size="medium">
  This is some text
</Text>
```

You can change the props as usual:

```jsx harmony
<Text color="primary300" size="large">
  This is some bigger text
</Text>
```

You can also change the underlying dom element:

```jsx harmony
<Text color="red300" size="large" as="p">
  This is the same bigger text as a paragraph tag
</Text>
```
